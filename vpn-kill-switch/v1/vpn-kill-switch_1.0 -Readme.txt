# Introduction

This script will run as a daemon service and restrict all your incoming and outgoing traffic only via a configured VPN connection. In case of a communication failure (VPN connection brekdown) all the connections will be restricted.

# An Internet kill switch is the cybercrime and countermeasures concept of activating a single shut off mechanism for all Internet traffic. The theory behind a kill switch is creation of a single point of control for one authority or another to control in order to shut down the Internet to protect it from unspecified assailants; (Wikipedia)

# Prerequisites:

            ns-cert-type server
            nobind
            script-security 2
            askpass {PATH TO PASSWORD FILE}
            log-append {VPN LOG FILE LOCATION}
            up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf.sh
            down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf.sh
