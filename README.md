# Steps to install bash scripts.


1. check the for dependencies and install before runing the scripts. 

2. move the scripts to an executable path (~/bash_utils/vX).

3. edit the bash profile and append the script location to PATH:
`export PATH=$PATH:~/bash_utils/vX`

4. Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure hence, add to a wallet or env. variable.
